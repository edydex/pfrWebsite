                <p>PFR advises districts in every phase of the design, construction, and renovation of schools. We are proficient in the acquisition of new school sites through negotiated purchase as well as through the power of eminent domain. In developing land, our experience in drafting and administering land use and growth management rules for our municipal clients provides valuable insights for schools navigating the maze of local land use regulations. We also handle all aspects of the contractual relationship with architects and general contractors, from requests for proposals and bid documents though project award and completion, including the resolution of claims and disputes.</p>
