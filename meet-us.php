            <p>Porter Foster Rorick is a select group of lawyers dedicated to the practice of school law. All of our attorneys have earned distinguished records of academic and professional achievement and all of our attorneys choose to practice with PFR because of our focus on public education. As a firm, we are bound together by a continuing commitment to responsive, practical, cost-effective service—as litigators, as bargainers and most of all as trusted counselors to public schools.</p>
            <p>Our firm traces its roots to the law practice begun by Jim Dionne in the 1970s and his efforts to develop strong, collaborative relationships with school districts on the Kitsap and Olympic peninsulas. Under the name Dionne & Rorick, this practice grew in the 1990s into a full-service, general counsel law firm for local governments with the support of Mike Rorick’s public sector litigation experience and the addition of Cliff Foster’s established school law practice. Today, Porter Foster Rorick represents more than 100 public school districts up and down the entire length of the I-5 corridor and on both sides of the Cascade mountains.</p>
            <p>At PFR, everything we do is designed to make it easy for our clients to get the answers they need to important legal questions. Each of our attorneys is trained in multiple areas of school law, and we consistently work together as a team on behalf of our clients. This approach allows us to respond promptly to client inquiries and collaborate effectively on any legal matter.</p>
