                <h2>Student Civil Rights</h2>
                <p>PFR assists its school clients with strategies for maintaining a safe and productive educational environment while respecting the rights of students. Our work includes providing counsel on individual cases and offering professional development to keep our clients up-to-date on issues of student civil rights and discipline. We also work with districts to develop appropriate student policies and prepare administrators before problems arise, minimizing the need for adversarial proceedings. When conflicts are unavoidable, we aggressively pursue the option most consistent with our client’s interests, whether it be mediation, administrative hearings, or litigation.</p>
