                <h2>Schools Administration</h2>
                <p>The attorneys of PFR have provided advice and representation on virtually every subject administrators face in the day-to-day operation of schools. Whenever possible, we use this experience proactively, to help school boards and superintendents avoid problems before they occur. We also know that most decisions made by school districts will face scrutiny from a wide array of public interests. With this understanding, we can assist our clients in improving performance while ensuring public accountability.</p>
