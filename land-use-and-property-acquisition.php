                <h2>Land Use &amp; Property Acquisition</h2>
                <p>PFR’s broad variety of municipal clients provides us the unique opportunity to understand land use and development issues from the perspectives of both regulator and owner/developer. Our experience working for cities provides us with particular insight and creativity when it comes to assisting our municipal clients with development of new public facilities. Our experience with other types of local government informs PFR’s approach to helping cities and towns effectively pursue the goals of preserving neighborhoods, protecting the environment, promoting economic development, safeguarding individual property rights, and making sure land is preserved for parks, green spaces, and municipal facilities.</p>
