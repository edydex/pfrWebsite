                <p>At the heart of every municipal corporation are dedicated public servants. We assist clients with the practical management of the personnel issues that come with this unique workforce, including challenges associated with civil service and labor relations, and compliance with the complex laws regulating fair employment practices. PFR’s attorneys also have a wealth of experience helping public agencies defend personnel decisions in a wide variety of litigation forums including arbitrations and administrative hearings as well as state and federal court.</p>
