                <h2>Municipal Governance &amp; Administration</h2>
                <p>PFR helps elected officials and municipal staff administer their local governments in an ethical, efficient and accountable manner. We regularly attend and advise our clients at council and commission meetings, fielding procedural and substantive legal questions—frequently with little notice. We are skilled drafters of local laws and policies, and often are called upon to interpret questions of municipal authority. We also counsel and defend municipalities on open government issues, including public disclosure and responses to burdensome records requests.</p>
