                <p>PFR’s public works experience empowers our clients to respond to and solve challenges in planning, financing, developing and operating public facilities. We have assisted municipalities with expansion and defense of service areas, managed financing mechanisms such as local improvement districts, and litigated challenges to rates and charges. Our attorneys frequently develop and review bidding materials and public works contracts, defend against bid protests, and litigate construction disputes.</p>
