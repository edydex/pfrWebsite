                <h2>Special Education</h2>
                <p>Laws governing special education have created a number of complicated and challenging issues for schools. PFR is experienced in handling the most difficult of these special education cases as well as cases involving students with a wide range of disabilities. We regularly advise schools on best practices for special education and legally defensible education planning and frequently litigate special education cases before administrative law judges and all levels of the federal courts.</p>
