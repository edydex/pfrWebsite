            <p>We believe that education is the most important function of state and local government. During the last 40 years, we have worked with over 120 Washington school districts, ranging in size from 50 to more than 50,000 students. We offer a practical, results-oriented approach to dealing with legal issues, grounded in a thorough understanding of the environment in which schools operate. By working with school districts to identify and resolve their legal issues, we free them to concentrate on their most important job—the education of public school students.</p>
