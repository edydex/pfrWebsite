                <h2>Public Safety</h2>
                <p>Cities and special purpose districts are the guardians of public safety and the legal issues that come with this responsibility span both the traditional civil and criminal areas of the law. PFR’s experience also spans both areas of the law: we’ve helped public agencies finance emergency response services, we’ve defended police officers from excessive force claims and we’ve prosecuted criminals in municipal court. In every case, our goal is to assist public agencies in protecting public safety in the most responsive and effective way possible.</p>
