                <p><strong>Porter Foster Rorick is a select group of lawyers</strong> dedicated to the practice of school law. All of our attorneys have earned distinguished records of academic and professional achievement and choose to practice with PFR because of our focus on public education. As a firm, we are bound together by a continuing commitment to responsive, practical, cost-effective service—as litigators, as bargainers and most of all as trusted counselors to public schools.</p>
                
 <p><strong>PFR seeks to add one or two attorneys per year</strong> to our growing practice. Successful candidates bring clear evidence of strong analytical skill, demonstrated through compelling legal writing, and a commitment to excellence through experiences such as law review or judicial clerkships. We also place great value in a candidate's ability to expand the diversity of backgrounds and experiences among our team of attorneys.</p>
