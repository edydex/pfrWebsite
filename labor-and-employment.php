                <h2>Labor &amp; Employment</h2>
                <p>Nothing is more important to a school district’s ability to provide high quality education than its employees. For this reason, labor and employment law has always been an important part of our practice. Every day we help schools with the practical management of personnel issues, including investigations, implementation of union contracts, and compliance with the complex laws regulating fair employment practices. Our attorneys have also earned a reputation for being effective labor negotiators, using both traditional and collaborative models of bargaining. Since the advent of collective bargaining for public school employees, we have successfully negotiated hundreds of agreements and developed productive relationships with bargaining units across the state.</p>
